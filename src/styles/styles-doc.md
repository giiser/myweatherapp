# Fonts
## Font Sizing & Hierarchy
A clear typographic scale is essential to guide the user's eye. Based on your design, here is a recommended structure for font sizes and weights.

**Large Display Temperature (e.g., 22°C)**
- Font Size: 80px 
- Font Weight: Light or Regular 
- Rationale: The immense size provides all the necessary impact, so a lighter weight keeps it feeling elegant and not overly bulky.

**App Title (e.g., Weather App)**
- Font Size: 22px
- Font Weight: SemiBold 
- Rationale: Clearly labels the screen without competing with the primary weather data.

**Primary Text & Data (e.g., Partly Cloudy, 5-Day Forecast)**
- Font Size: 18px 
- Font Weight: Medium 
- Rationale: For the main weather description and section headers. 
 
**Secondary Data (e.g., 65%, 12 km/h, 1013 hPa)**
- Font Size: 16px
- Font Weight: Bold 
- Rationale: Makes the key metrics stand out clearly.

**Labels (e.g., Humidity, Wind Speed, Pressure)**
- Font Size: 14px
- Font Weight: Regular
- Rationale: Clearly labels the data points below them without adding visual clutter.

**List Items (e.g., Dropdown locations, 5-Day Forecast rows)**
- Font Size: 17px
- Font Weight: Regular for text (e.g., "Today"), Medium for temperatures (e.g., 24°).
- Rationale: A comfortable, legible size for tappable list items.
